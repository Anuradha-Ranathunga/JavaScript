    <p class="test"> I have a pet dog named Bruno. He is brown and furry. He is named after my motherâ€™s favourite singer, 
        Bruno Mars. Bruno came into my life when I was 4 years old. I clearly remember the day when I saw him 
        for the first time. My older brother and I went to the Adoption Centre for Rescued Dogs. 
        Initially, Bruno was very scared of everything around him.</p>
